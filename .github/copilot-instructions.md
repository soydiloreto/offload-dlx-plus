# Copilot custom instructions — Offload+

This file is the project-wide context for GitHub Copilot (Code Review,
Chat, Coding Agent, and any other surface that reads
`.github/copilot-instructions.md`). It encodes domain knowledge,
conventions, and review priorities specific to this codebase. It is **not**
generic WordPress advice — it reflects how this plugin is actually
written.

When you review a pull request, follow these rules. When in doubt, prefer
the project's existing patterns over textbook WordPress patterns.

## What this repo is

WordPress plugin that offloads media files to cloud object storage and
serves them back transparently. Two providers ship today: **Azure Blob
Storage** (bring your own credentials) and **Dilux One Cloud** (managed,
paid). The plugin is GPL-2.0-or-later, free for both providers, and the
Dilux One paid tier exists only as a convenience for users who don't want
to manage their own cloud account.

**The plugin's distinguishing technical decision** is the use of a PHP
**stream wrapper** to intercept every read and write to
`/wp-content/uploads/`. This means **no URL rewriting** in post content,
**no database migration** of attachment URLs, and full compatibility with
WooCommerce, page builders, image editors, and any plugin that uses
standard PHP filesystem functions (`fopen`, `file_get_contents`, `unlink`,
etc.). Keep this principle in mind: any proposal that would require
rewriting URLs, post content, or database rows is almost certainly the
wrong direction.

## Architecture quick-reference

PHP namespace: `OffloadDlxPlus\`. Class autoloading is via a custom
mapping in `includes/enhanced-autoloader.php` (NOT Composer, NOT PSR-4
strict). The mixed file-naming style (`class-offload-dlx-plus-*.php` for older files,
`PascalCase.php` for newer DTOs/Enums) is intentional — the autoloader
handles both.

| Path | Contains |
|------|----------|
| `offload-dlx-plus.php` | Main plugin file. Defines constants, registers autoloader, bootstraps `Plugin`. |
| `includes/class-offload-dlx-plus-plugin-enhanced.php` | `Plugin` — top-level orchestration, modern AJAX handlers (sync engine moved here from `Admin`). |
| `includes/class-offload-dlx-plus-admin.php` | `Admin` — admin UI, menu, page rendering, AJAX handlers, settings save/load, connection-health banner. |
| `includes/class-offload-dlx-plus-cloud-stream-wrapper.php` | `CloudStreamWrapper` — implements PHP stream wrapper. Performance-critical. |
| `includes/class-offload-dlx-plus-config-manager.php` | `ConfigManager` — single source of truth for plugin config + connection-health state. Encrypts credentials at rest via `Crypto`. |
| `includes/class-offload-dlx-plus-crypto.php` | `Crypto` — AES-256-GCM, key derived from WP salts. |
| `includes/class-offload-dlx-plus-logger.php` | `Logger` — the ONLY place `error_log()` is called. Dedupe + level-gated. |
| `includes/class-offload-dlx-plus-sync-manager.php` | `SyncManager` — sync state machine, parallel/chunked uploads. |
| `includes/class-offload-dlx-plus-db.php` | DB layer for sync state custom table. Uses `$wpdb->prepare()` everywhere. |
| `includes/class-offload-dlx-plus-validation-helper.php` | `ValidationHelper` — input validation utilities. |
| `includes/class-offload-dlx-plus-mime-helper.php` | `MimeHelper` — extension → MIME mapping. |
| `includes/class-offload-dlx-plus-cleanup.php` | Plugin uninstall / cleanup logic. |
| `includes/interfaces/interface-cloud-storage-client.php` | `CloudStorageClientInterface` — contract for all providers. |
| `includes/factories/class-cloud-storage-factory.php` | `CloudStorageFactory::create($provider, $config)`. |
| `includes/providers/class-azure-provider.php` | `AzureProvider` — Azure Blob Storage REST API. |
| `includes/providers/class-diluxone-cloud-provider.php` | `DiluxOneCloudProvider` — Dilux One REST API at `https://api.diluxone.com/cloud-storage-wp/v1`. |
| `includes/Enums/class-plugin-state.php` | `Enums\PluginState` (string constants, NOT PHP 8.1 enum — PHP 7.4 minimum). |
| `includes/Enums/SyncStatus.php` | `Enums\SyncStatus`. |
| `includes/DTOs/*.php` | Value objects with `->toArray()` — `PluginConfig`, `AzureConfig`, `ConnectionResult`, `FileInfo`, `OperationResult`, `UploadResult`, `SyncProgress`, etc. |
| `includes/class-offload-dlx-plus-image-editor-{gd,imagick}.php` | Image-editor adapters that play nicely with the stream wrapper. |
| `templates/admin-*.php` | Admin views (rendered by `Admin`). One file per tab: Overview, Cloud Provider, Sync, Offloading, Activity, Settings, Status & Tools. |
| `assets/css/admin.css`, `assets/js/admin.js` | Plugin runtime assets bundled with the plugin. |
| `languages/*.{po,mo,pot}` | Translations. Locales: `es_AR`, `es_ES`, `es_MX`, `pt_BR`, `pt_PT`, `fr_FR`, `de_DE`, `it_IT`. Text domain: `offload-dlx-plus`. |
| `.wordpress-org/` | Banner / icon / screenshots for the wp.org listing. NOT runtime assets. |

## Plugin state machine — the canonical flow

Defined in `Enums\PluginState`. Valid states only:

```
NOT_CONFIGURED → CONFIGURED → SYNCING → SYNCED → OFFLOADING_ACTIVE
```

Transitions:
- `NOT_CONFIGURED → CONFIGURED`: user enters provider credentials and they validate.
- `CONFIGURED → SYNCING`: user clicks **Start Sync**.
- `SYNCING → SYNCED`: sync completes.
- `SYNCED → OFFLOADING_ACTIVE`: user enables offloading; stream wrapper takes over.
- `OFFLOADING_ACTIVE → SYNCED`: user deactivates offloading.

⚠️ **Removed in October 2025 cleanup** (do NOT reintroduce):
- `DISCONNECTING` state — never used. Reverse sync (downloading files back from cloud) happens WHILE the plugin remains in `OFFLOADING_ACTIVE`. After reverse sync finishes, the user must manually click "Deactivate Offloading" to transition to `SYNCED`.
- `ERROR` state — never used. Errors are tracked at the file level (sync failures) and at the connection level (connection health), NOT at the plugin level.

If a PR proposes adding a new top-level state, push back unless there is a concrete user-visible scenario that the existing five states cannot represent.

---

## Connection health model

Stored in WP option `offload_dlx_plus_connection_health`. The shape:

```php
[
    'is_healthy'           => bool,
    'error_code'           => string|null, // e.g. 'decrypt_failed', '401', '403', '404', 'exception'
    'error_message'        => string|null,
    'consecutive_failures' => int,
    'last_check'           => int (timestamp),
]
```

Conventions:
- **Failure recording is idempotent for the same error_code.** `ConfigManager::record_failure()` does NOT bump `consecutive_failures` if the previous failure had the same code. This prevents `decrypt_failed` from inflating the counter on every page load.
- **The stream wrapper falls back to local storage when `consecutive_failures >= 3`.** That threshold is the agreed safety valve. Don't change it without discussion.
- **Two helpers map `error_code` to user-facing copy**, both in `Admin`: `pause_reason_short(string $error_code): string` and `health_banner_copy(string $error_code, string $error_message): array`. The same vocabulary appears in the banner, the Status cards, and the Overview cards. If you add a new error_code, update BOTH helpers.

## Hard rules — please flag any violation

### Security (highest priority)

- **All AJAX endpoints** must call `check_ajax_referer('offload_dlx_plus_admin', 'nonce')` AND `current_user_can('manage_options')`. The pattern is established and consistent across `Admin::ajax_*` methods. Any new AJAX action without both checks is a defect.
- **All `$_POST` / `$_GET` input** must be sanitized: `sanitize_text_field`, `sanitize_url`, `sanitize_email`, or `wp_kses` for HTML. Never trust raw `$_POST['x']`.
- **All output** must be escaped: `esc_html`, `esc_attr`, `esc_url`, `esc_textarea`. Never echo a variable into HTML without escaping.
- **All SQL** must use `$wpdb->prepare()`. Concatenating user input into SQL strings is a defect, even when the value "looks safe". `class-offload-dlx-plus-db.php` is the reference for the correct pattern.
- **Credentials must NEVER appear in logs.** This includes Azure access keys, Dilux One API keys, decrypted plaintext credentials, and anything in the `provider_config` array. The pattern `Logger::error('failed: ' . print_r($config, true))` is forbidden — that array contains the credential. When logging connection failures, log the `error_code` and a sanitized `error_message`, not the full payload. The connection-health system is designed for this purpose; use it.
- **Encryption is AES-256-GCM with a key derived from WP salts** (`wp_salt('auth') . wp_salt('secure_auth')` via HMAC-SHA256). Do not propose downgrading the cipher, removing GCM authentication, switching to CBC, accepting a plaintext fallback, or persisting the key anywhere. The `Crypto::encrypt()` / `Crypto::decrypt()` interface is stable; if a credential cannot be decrypted, `decrypt()` returns `null` and the caller surfaces the failure to the user (`decrypt_failed` connection-health event). There is intentionally no fallback to plaintext storage.
- **The `OFFLOADDLXPLUSENC1:` prefix on encrypted values is a versioning hint.** A future key rotation may bump it. Don't strip it, parse it manually, or assume specific positions of bytes after it.

### WordPress conventions

- All user-facing strings must be wrapped in WordPress translation functions (`__()`, `_e()`, `_n()`, `esc_html__()`, `esc_html_e()`, etc.) with the text domain `offload-dlx-plus`. The plugin ships translations for 8 locales — a hardcoded English string regresses all of them.
- `current_user_can('manage_options')` is the standard capability check for admin operations. We don't define custom capabilities (yet).
- Multisite-aware: per-site configuration is the default. Network-level configuration is opt-in via specific helpers, not a global toggle. When in doubt, behave per-site.
- **Database access goes through `$wpdb->prepare()`.** Never concatenate user input. The wpdb instance is the global `$wpdb`; in classes, declare it `global` inside the method.
- For HTTP calls to providers, use `wp_remote_get`, `wp_remote_post`, `wp_remote_head`, `wp_remote_request` — NEVER raw cURL. **Always pass an explicit `timeout`**: 30 seconds for short metadata operations, 300 seconds for file transfers. Defaulting to no-timeout is a hung-request bug waiting to happen.

### Compatibility

- **PHP 7.4 minimum.** Do NOT use:
  - PHP 8.0+ syntax: named arguments, `match()`, constructor property promotion, nullsafe `?->`, `mixed` return type, throw expressions.
  - PHP 8.1+ syntax: `readonly` properties, native `enum` (this is why `PluginState` is a class with `const`, not an `enum`), first-class callable syntax `f(...)`.
  - PHP 8.2+ syntax: readonly classes, DNF types, `null`/`true`/`false` standalone types.
- **WordPress 5.0 minimum.** Don't use APIs added later than 5.0 without a `function_exists()` guard.
- All `.php` files must start with `if (!defined('ABSPATH')) { exit; }` immediately after the namespace declaration. This is enforced project-wide.

### Logging

- **`Logger` is the only place `error_log()` should be called directly.** That class has a file-wide `phpcs:disable WordPress.PHP.DevelopmentFunctions.error_log_error_log`. Anywhere else, calling `error_log()` is a defect — use `Logger::error()`, `Logger::warning()`, `Logger::info()`, or `Logger::debug()`.
- `error` and `warning` are always written. `info` and `debug` are gated by the verbose-logging flag (Settings tab toggle, `OFFLOAD_DLX_PLUS_VERBOSE_LOGGING` constant, or `WP_DEBUG`).
- The logger dedupes identical messages within a 5-minute window. This is intentional for hot paths (stream wrapper, cache lookups). Don't try to defeat the dedupe with random suffixes.

### Performance

- **`CloudStreamWrapper` is the hot path.** Every media read/write in the WordPress install goes through it. Avoid:
  - Synchronous network calls inside `stream_read`, `stream_write`, `url_stat` unless a cache miss.
  - Allocations of large strings or arrays per call.
  - `error_log` calls in hot methods (use `Logger::debug` so they're gated).
- **Connection-health checks must be idempotent.** A repeated `decrypt_failed` event must NOT inflate `consecutive_failures` on every page load. The pattern is in `ConfigManager::record_failure()` — preserve it.
- For sync, the engine uses parallel/chunked uploads via `prepare_batch_upload_handle()` and `prepare_chunked_upload_handle()` on the provider. Don't introduce sequential per-file loops in new sync paths.

## Style — please DO NOT comment on

Save your review tokens for things that matter:

- **Yoda conditions are NOT used.** This codebase uses `$x === 5`, not `5 === $x`. Don't suggest the swap.
- **`function_name_in_snake_case`** is intentional for free functions and methods (WordPress standard). Don't suggest camelCase.
- **`Class\Names\InPascalCase`** for namespaced classes is correct. Don't suggest snake_case for them.
- The mixed file-naming style (`class-offload-dlx-plus-*.php` AND `PascalCase.php`) is **deliberate and handled by the autoloader**. Don't suggest renaming files for consistency.
- **Multiple AJAX action prefixes** (`wp_ajax_offload_dlx_plus_*`) are deliberate — older handlers live in `Admin`, newer ones in `Plugin`. The split is in the middle of an organic refactor; don't suggest re-merging.
- **The `⭐` emoji and dated comments** (e.g. "CLEANUP 2025-10-11") are intentional historical markers. Don't suggest removing them; they explain *why* something was changed.

## What Copilot should actively look for

Use review tokens HERE. These are the failure modes that have actually shown up in this codebase or are likely to:

- **Missing escaping on output.** A new template that does `<?php echo $foo ?>` instead of `<?php echo esc_html($foo) ?>` is a defect.
- **Missing sanitization on input.** A new AJAX handler that reads `$_POST['x']` and stores it without `sanitize_text_field()` (or stricter) is a defect.
- **Missing `check_ajax_referer` or `current_user_can` on a new AJAX handler.** Both are required.
- **Plain SQL strings instead of `$wpdb->prepare()`.** Even for "simple" queries with `intval()`-cast inputs, the convention is `prepare()`.
- **New external HTTP calls without `timeout`** in the args. Always specify, never default.
- **New external HTTP calls without integration with the connection-health system.** Provider classes record failures via `ConfigManager::record_failure()`. New calls that fail silently break the banner / fallback logic.
- **New strings not wrapped in `__()`** — particularly when adding admin UI text or error messages.
- **Hardcoded English strings inside `templates/`.** Templates are the most common place for accidental untranslated strings.
- **Logging credentials.** Any `Logger::*` or `error_log` line that includes a `provider_config`, `access_key`, `api_key`, `password`, decrypted ciphertext, or `print_r($config)` is a defect.
- **Direct `error_log()` calls outside `Logger`.** Defect.
- **PHP 8.0+ syntax slipping in.** Named args, `match`, nullsafe, etc. — flag and reject.
- **New top-level plugin states.** Push back hard unless justified.
- **File handles or stream resources not closed.** In `class-offload-dlx-plus-sync-manager.php` and the stream wrapper, leaks compound under high upload counts.
- **`$wpdb` queries inside loops.** Suggest batching when you see a `foreach { $wpdb->... }` pattern in a non-trivial loop.

## When you're not sure

- Open a question in the PR review comment. Don't guess.
- Reference the relevant existing pattern by file and class (e.g. "see `Admin::ajax_test_connection` for the standard nonce + capability + sanitize sequence").
- The maintainer ([Pablo Di Loreto](https://pablodiloreto.com/)) is the final reviewer of every merge. Your job is to surface what matters; the merge decision is human.

## Updates to this file

When the plugin's architecture, conventions, or rules change, update this file in the same PR. A stale `copilot-instructions.md` is worse than none — it makes Copilot give confidently-wrong reviews.
