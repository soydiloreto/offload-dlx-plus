Offload WordPress media to cloud storage (Azure, Dilux One — more coming). Transparent /uploads/ replacement via PHP stream wrappers.

== Description ==

Offload Plus moves your WordPress media library to cloud object storage and serves files directly from the cloud — without breaking the Media Library UI, plugins, or existing content.

The plugin uses a custom PHP stream wrapper to intercept every read and write to `/wp-content/uploads/`, so WordPress, WooCommerce, page builders, image editors, and any plugin that calls standard filesystem functions (`fopen`, `file_get_contents`, `unlink`, etc.) keep working unchanged.

= Key features =

* **Two providers supported out of the box**
  * Azure Blob Storage (bring-your-own credentials).
  * Dilux One Cloud (managed — get an API key from [diluxone.com](https://diluxone.com/)).
* **Transparent stream wrapper** — no URL rewriting, no regex on post content, no database migration required for URLs.
* **Sync with resumable state machine** — start, pause, resume, cancel, retry failed files, resync from scratch.
* **Offloading mode** — after a successful sync you can delete the local copies to free disk space; the stream wrapper keeps everything working.
* **Connection health monitoring** — automatic fallback to local storage when cloud is unreachable, with a persistent banner in the admin.
* **Custom domain / CDN support** — serve media from your own domain or CDN edge.
* **Import / export of configuration** — JSON-based for environment mirroring.
* **Multisite aware** — per-site or network-level configuration.
* **Debug logging toggle** — built-in verbose logging that respects WP_DEBUG and the admin Settings toggle.

= Why a stream wrapper instead of URL rewriting =

Most offload plugins rewrite media URLs in post content, which breaks when you switch providers, move domains, or restore from a backup. Offload Plus leaves URLs alone and rewrites reads/writes at the filesystem layer, so your content stays portable.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `offload-plus` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`, or install via the WordPress Plugins screen.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen in WordPress.
3. Open the new **Offload Plus** menu in the admin sidebar.
4. Go to **Cloud Provider**, pick your provider, enter credentials, and click **Test Connection**.
5. Save the configuration.
6. Go to **Sync & Offloading**, run the initial sync, and enable offloading when sync is complete.

= Requirements =

* WordPress 5.0 or higher.
* PHP 7.4 or higher.
* `ext-curl` and `ext-openssl` enabled.
* Writable `wp-content/uploads/` directory during sync (needed for temporary files).
* For Azure: a Blob Storage account and access key.
* For Dilux One Cloud: an API key.

== External Services ==

This plugin integrates with third-party cloud storage services. **Nothing is sent to any external service until you explicitly enable a provider** in the *Cloud Provider* tab. You always choose which service to use and supply your own credentials or API key.

= Azure Blob Storage =

When Azure is selected as the active provider, the plugin sends your media files and their metadata (file path, file size, MIME type, content) to your own Azure Blob Storage account at `https://<your-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net` using the Azure Blob REST API. Authentication is performed with the storage account key you provide. The plugin issues these requests:

* During the initial sync — to upload existing files from `/wp-content/uploads/` to your container.
* On every new media upload — to write the file to the cloud transparently via the stream wrapper.
* On read or delete — when WordPress (or any plugin using filesystem APIs against `/uploads/`) reads or deletes a file.
* Periodic connection-health checks (lightweight HEAD requests).

This is **your own Azure account**. Offload Plus is not involved and has no access to your data.

= Dilux One Cloud =

When Dilux One Cloud is selected as the active provider, the plugin connects to the Dilux One Cloud REST API at `https://api.diluxone.com/cloud-storage-wp/v1` using the API key you provide. The plugin issues these requests:

* `POST /auth/verify` — to validate the API key when you click *Test Connection*.
* `POST /storage/sas-token` — to obtain a short-lived upload URL before each upload.
* `GET /stats` — to retrieve your storage and bandwidth usage shown on the *Overview* tab.
* File transfers (PUT/GET/DELETE) — sent to the URL returned by the SAS token endpoint.

Data sent to Dilux One Cloud: API key (in request header), file path, file size, MIME type, and file content. No information about visitors of your site is collected or transmitted.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin modify my existing media URLs in the database? =

No. The stream wrapper intercepts filesystem calls transparently — your post content, the `wp_posts` table, and the `wp_postmeta` table are never rewritten.

= What happens if the cloud is temporarily unreachable? =

The plugin monitors connection health. When the cloud is marked unhealthy, new uploads automatically fall back to local storage and an admin banner warns you. When the connection recovers, you can run a sync to push the fallback files up.

= Can I switch providers later? =

Yes. You can remove the current provider configuration from the admin, configure a new one, run a full resync, and the plugin will start serving from the new location. No URL rewriting required.

= Will this work with WooCommerce / Elementor / image editors? =

Yes. Because the stream wrapper operates at the filesystem layer, any plugin that reads or writes files under `/uploads/` using standard PHP functions works unchanged.

= Does the plugin delete my local files automatically? =

Only if you explicitly opt in. After a successful sync you can click **Delete local files** in the Sync & Offloading tab. Until you do that, files are kept in both locations.

= How do I enable verbose debug logging? =

Go to **Offload Plus → Settings → Enable detailed debug logging**. Logs are written to the standard PHP `error_log` destination. Disable it in production unless you are actively troubleshooting — it will impact performance.

= Is the plugin multisite compatible? =

Yes. You can configure per-site, or at the network level.

= How are my Azure / Dilux One credentials stored? =

The Azure access key and the Dilux One Cloud API key are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before they are written to the WordPress options table. The encryption key is derived from your site's WordPress salts (`AUTH_KEY` / `SECURE_AUTH_KEY` and the corresponding salts in `wp-config.php`), so a database dump on its own is not enough to recover the credentials — the attacker also needs filesystem access to `wp-config.php`.

If you ever rotate the WordPress salts, the existing encrypted credentials become unreadable; the plugin will surface the provider as "not configured" and you simply re-enter the credentials in the *Cloud Provider* tab. There is intentionally no plaintext fallback.

Requirements: PHP `ext-openssl` (enabled by default on virtually every host).

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.1.0 =
* Clearer error messages when the plugin cannot read your cloud credentials (for example after restoring the site database from another environment). The Cloud Provider, Sync, Status and Overview tabs now show the same paused state with specific guidance — previously some panels stayed green or showed contradictory information.

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release.

== Changelog ==

= 1.1.0 = (in development)
Consolidated release: bug fixes from the in-progress 1.0.1 line, plus repository tooling and documentation improvements that are not user-visible (development environment via wp-env, CI checks on pull requests, contributor documentation). The user-facing changelog entries below describe what changed for end users compared to 1.0.0.

Bug fixes
* The connection-health system now also fires when stored credentials cannot be **decrypted** (for example after restoring a database from another environment, where the WordPress salts no longer match the ones used to encrypt the credentials at rest). Previously the failure was only written to the debug log; the admin had no visible signal and saw silently inconsistent state across tabs.
* The red admin banner is now tailored per failure mode (`decrypt_failed`, `401`/`403`, `404`, `exception`) with a clear title, explanation and call to action — no more generic "Cloud Connection Error" for every failure.
* The **Sync & Offloading** tab no longer shows the misleading "Steps to Enable Sync" copy when the real problem is unreadable credentials. It now distinguishes "never configured" from "credentials cannot be decrypted" and points the admin straight to the Cloud Provider tab to re-enter them.
* The **Status** tab cards (Plugin State, Configuration, Offloading) no longer show contradictory information (e.g. "Configuration: Not Configured" together with "Offloading: Active") when the connection is unhealthy. All four cards now coherently surface a "paused" state with the same root cause.
* The **Overview** tab cards apply the same coherence rules: when paused, the Configuration / Synchronization / Offloading cards switch to a warning style with the short pause reason, instead of staying green while the rest of the admin reports the failure.

Internal
* `ConfigManager::decrypt_credentials()` now records a `decrypt_failed` connection-health event once per failure cycle (idempotent — does not inflate `consecutive_failures` on every page load).
* New `Admin::pause_reason_short()` and `Admin::health_banner_copy()` helpers map a connection-health `error_code` to the user-facing copy used throughout the admin, so the same vocabulary appears in the banner, the Status cards and the Overview cards.
